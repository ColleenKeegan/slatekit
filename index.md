# Slate
---
Slate-Source is a simple, and very useful micro-framework and utility library built in Scala. It provides the technical foundation to quickly build Scala apps. Save time and effort on technical infrastructure so you can focus on building the business features of your product or start-up. Slate is built on the concept of using modular, re-usable code and components to get your apps developed, and rolled out to users as quickly as possible.

    showResults( Args.parse( "-env:dev -text:'hello word' -batch:10" ) )

    // Use case 2: Custom prefix and sep e.g. "!" and separator "="
    showResults( Args.parse( "!env=dev !text='hello word' !batch=10 ", prefix = "!", sep = "=" ) )

    // Use case 3a: Check for method call in the beginning
    showResults( Args.parse( "service.method -env=dev -text='hello word' -batch=10", prefix = "-",
                 sep = "=", hasAction = true ) )

    // Use case 3b: Check for method call in the beginning
    showResults( Args.parse( "method -env=dev -text='hello word' -batch=10", prefix = "-",
                 sep = "=", hasAction = true ) )

    // Use case 4: No args
    showResults( Args.parse( "service.method", prefix = "-", sep = "=", hasAction = true ) )

    // Use case 5a: Help request ( "?", "help")
    showResults( Args.parse( "?"         ) )

    // Use case 5b: Help request with method call ( "method.action" ? )
    showResults( Args.parse( "service.method help"   , hasAction = true ) )

    // Use case 6: Version request ( "ver", "version" )
    showResults( Args.parse( "version"  ) )

    // Use case 7: Exit request
    showResults( Args.parse( "exit"     ) )

    // Use case 8: apply args to an object
    Args.apply( "-env:dev -text:'hello word' -batch:10", new SampleOptions(), "-", ":", true)
